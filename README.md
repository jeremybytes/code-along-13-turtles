# Code-Along: Thirteen ways of looking at a turtle

Coding along with the article [Thirteen ways of looking at a turtle](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/13-ways-of-looking-at-a-turtle/) by Scott Wlashin.  

This code varies a bit from the article since it uses a later version of F#, but it matches the article's code repository (for the most part).
